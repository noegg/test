**Part 1: Project background and introduction**

This report is the summary of an 18-month long qualitative research project, *Security in Context,* that examines the long term impacts of digital security teaching practices for, and learning experiences of, human rights defenders (HRDs). Conducted between 2013 and 2015, this research study examines the contexts in which the training of and learning by HRDs takes place, and documents and analyses the experiences of digital security trainers and the HRDs they work with.

The overall project consists of two research studies: the first focused on digital security trainers' perspectives on the development and impact of digital security trainings (referred to as Part 2 in this report). The second looked at the experiences of HRDs adopting digital security and privacy practices after trainings, and how and if these practices helped them adapt to threats (referred to as Part 3 in this report). In combination, the findings and recommendations from both research studies provide a previously unavailable body of knowledge and findings about digital security trainings as part of protection capacity-building for HRDs. Due to the extensive nature of the research reports and of the findings, only the highlights are summarized here; the full-length research reports are available on request from Tactical Tech.

The process and findings from this research will help inform future applied research projects, the design and testing of new training approaches, models, and curriculum, as well as contribute to a sector-wide discussion with the wider training community. We also see this research as an opportunity to engage with methodological and ethical debates on digital security research. This is also an important opportunity to inform the donor and evaluation communities on how to fund and assess this work more effectively.

**Project Background:** Digital security and privacy issues are challenging for most Internet users, but are particularly problematic for human rights defenders (HRDs). HRDs are engaged in challenging the excesses of authoritarian regimes and corporations, witnessing human rights violations, documenting the degradation of the environment, and promoting transparency and accountability. They are operating within significantly stressful, traumatizing, and demanding circumstances with limited resources, and their activities make them targets of surveillance, violence, and monitoring by the institutions and authorities they challenge.

To reduce the amplified risks uniquely enabled by the convergence of digital and physical threats, HRDs need to develop, implement, and sustain collective security and privacy practices while navigating complex and fluctuating political, legal, and social contexts. Widespread adoption and dependence on popular commercial technologies often enable opportunities for surveillance and attacks by adversaries due to poor security and privacy features. Developing and enacting appropriate digital and holistic security policies is one set of challenges among many for HRDs. They also face a combination of individual and collective challenges: not only do they have to find ways to change their tools, use of commercial services and workflows, but they must also must persuade and then help those around them to do the same. Without engaging people they work with in this effort, HRDs and advocates have no one to implement digital security practices with, largely rendering the collective and individual protection benefits void.

Since there is no quick digital security fix in today's technology landscape, this is a complicated endeavour. Activists and human rights organisations often have limited technological support, while sophisticated surveillance attacks are well-resourced and complex. The practice and format of digital security trainings emerged more than a decade ago as a strategy to help HRDs understand and manage their technology use. The content, methodologies, and design of digital trainings has drastically evolved, expanded, and diversified, often at a very slow iterative pace through trial-and-error by isolated trainers. Today, this is a field with a wide variety of trainers who vary in their professional experiences, approaches, resources, backgrounds, and contexts. But the current range of training formats and their strategic deployment within larger, comprehensive capacity-building efforts remain relatively limited and opportune for applied research and piloting of new models.

**TTC's Approach to Training:** TTC trainers were 'embedded' in the second research project described in this report, which looks at the contexts of adoption of digital security skills by HRDs. There was one digital security trainer and one researcher-trainer in this project. By contrast the first research study that surveys digital security trainers does not exclusively represent TTC's Training Program. Five current and past staff members of TTC were part of the 23 trainers interviewed for the first research study, and a number of other interviewees have close ties with or have collaborated with TTC.

TTC's trainers are dedicated to a participatory methodology that uses best practices from adult learning pedagogies in order to facilitate a varied and fulfilling learning experience for people of all learning styles. TTC's trainers take a 'trainer-facilitator' approach where workshops are co-created by the 'trainer'[1] <span id="SiC_Funder_Summary" class="anchor"></span>and participants. We strive to 'meet participants where they are,' and work to understand their existing practices as part of their unique situation and practices. Although we use Security-in-a-Box as a resource, we do not have a standard curriculum of tools and tactics which we feel are universally relevant, appropriate or applicable. Rather, our aim is for HRDs to apply their own critical thinking to apply a broader repertoire of tools and tactics that we train them to use according to their own needs. We consider funded, structured trainings to not be the only possible model, and are exploring how to develop and support more community- and peer-based models. We've observed that the best training results are achieved when participants have a pre-existing need to use their newly acquired knowledge and have a peer network to use it with. We hew to a ratio of 1 trainer for every 8 participants, to ensure dedicated attention to individual and group needs. Over the past three years, we've increased our awareness of different learning styles, increased our use of adult learning methodologies (especially [*ADIDS*](http://https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/preparing-ADIDS-sessions/)[2]), and explored more empowering ways to demonstrate technical vulnerabilities. We've also been happy to see the warm acceptance of our Holistic Security work, and a desire among trainers to continue learning new holistic training skills. Our participation in community-building efforts to support the collaboration and professionalisation of trainers has been valuable to our work, and we hope to continue in part by sharing our research findings here as a contribution to ongoing conversations in the training community.

**Project evolution from 'Behavior Change' to 'Security in Context':** This research was originally inspired by the idea of ‘behaviour change', a concept widely used in public health campaigns and climate change activism to describe the process of getting people to limit unhealthy and unsafe practices and adopt more healthy and beneficial ones. We started this work by looking at the literature around behaviour change, to critically examine it as a process through which HRDs are able to build habits and practices around the use of ICTs in a way that enables them to achieve their objectives, while navigating a complex environment of risk. The review of literature accompanying the research with HRDs describes this landscape. Through our work with this concept, we found that it was increasingly difficult to apply it to this research. This led us to adjust the focus to the deep contextual elements at play when working to change behavior through of digital security trainings.

Behaviour change often refers to the uptake of a particular set of practices pre-determined to be beneficial and appropriate. The use of the term behaviour change in different kinds of interventions may also imply that there is one correct route to change with a particular pre-defined desired result, and that this requires a user to change their actions in accordance with this preset path. Applied in the same way in digital security, this would imply that we could pre-define a set of behaviours to be privacy enhancing or aiding in controlling access to information. But this would not be advisable when looking at the real-world problems faced by HRDs. The framing around behaviour change interventions and communications also focuses on individuals in a way that implies that the burden of responsibility rests with the individual to change in the face of different forms of structural inequality. Work on digital security should push back against the notion that problems with privacy and security can be solved entirely by individuals acting alone without support. Our research shows clearly that privacy and security emerge from the collective efforts of individuals working together in groups – whether formal organizations or informal networks. Norms around privacy therefore need to shift from a focus on individual responsibility to support for individuals in working together, within groups.

TTC's aim is to support individuals and groups in finding contextually appropriate strategies that promote privacy and security within their social groups. It is for these reasons that we had to eventually move from using the term 'behaviour change' and shift to a framing of 'security in context'. While behavior change was a useful starting point our research, it was limited in illuminating how digital security practices develop and are sustained.

This report now presents the first of two Security in Context research studies that explore the practices and outcomes of digital security and privacy education and training. The first is a trainer-focused study that endeavours gain a deeper and broader sense of what digital security trainers do, how their work has evolved, and what they have observed working with HRDs over 15+ years of digital security trainings.[3] The second study found in Part 3, 'Security in Context', looks at the experiences of human rights defenders (HRDs) during trainings and their experiences adopting digital security and privacy practices.
